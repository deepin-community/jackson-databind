Comment: FasterXML used a dual licensing approach (Apache-2.0 or LGPL) [0]
 for jackson 2 by making suitably licensed jar files available for download.
 [1] Users were then free to choose the license they wanted by downloading
 the respective jar.
 .
 The source code itself was, however, never explicitly licensed. After raising
 this issue on the jackson-dev mailing list [2] FasterXML decided to license
 future versions of jackson 2 under Apache-2.0 only [3]. A copy of the
 license can be found in src/main/resources/META-INF/LICENSE.
